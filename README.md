ArduinoOnBeagleBone
===================

Arduino and AVR compilation tools for BeagleBone (currently command-line only)

This will give you the command-line tools needed to compile AVR programs
and Arduino sketches.  In this way it is similar to WinAVR for Windows and 
CrossPack for Mac OS X.

Specifically, the versions of the tools created are:
- avr binutils-2.22
- avr gcc-4.5.3
- avr-libc-1.8.0 
- avrdude 5.11.1
